Web-app matching users with job offers based on their profile.

====================== Author details ======================

Name: Thanasis

Current-Job:Web developer and Uni Student in Greece on Software Engineering

============================================================

This is my first web-app, it matches users with work positions.The code languages are PHP, MySQLi and CSS.

The porpuse for this application is to let a user create a profile,either for himself or a company, and then if he wants to get a job,
he can get auto matched with some open positions that meet his/her criteria,or if he is a complany or offers a job position to create
a job offer and provide with some auto matched job seekers that meet the criteria of the available position.

============================================================

In the current version it only gets to the point the lets you create a user,login,logout,edit your user and delete your user,create a job offer,edit it and/or delete it.

Make the mechanism responsible for the match of job offers and users work and maybe building an email alert when mached to an offer.

Any porposals are welcome! :)
