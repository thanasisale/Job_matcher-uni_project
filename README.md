# Job Matcher
Web-app matching users with job offers based on their profile.

====================== Author details ======================

Name: Thanasis

Current-Job:Web developer and Uni Student in Greece on Software Engineering

============================================================

This is my first web-app, it matches users with work positions.The code languages are PHP, MySQLi and CSS.

The porpuse for this application is to let a user create a profile,either for himself or a company, and then if he wants to get a job,
he can get auto matched with some open positions that meet his/her criteria,or if he is a complany or offers a job position to create
a job offer and provide with some auto matched job seekers that meet the criteria of the available position.

============================================================

In the current version it supports the creation of user/company profile,login,logout,edit your user/company profile delete your account,create a job offer,edit it and/or delete it and finaly it has the ability to mach based on cv and the open job proposals.

Some future additions should be to tighten the security of the app using php methods, sending mail or other type of alerts, add chat mechanism, make the matching function more sophisticated.

Any porposals are welcome! :)
