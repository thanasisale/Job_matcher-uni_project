Web-app matching users with topics of interest

====================== Author details ======================

Name: Thanasis

Current-Job:Web developer and Uni Student in Greece on Software Engineering

============================================================

This is my first web-app, it matches users with work positions.The code languages are html, php, MySQLi and css.

The porpuse for this application is to let a user create a profile,either for himself or a company, and then if he wants to get a job,
he can get auto matched with some open positions that meet his/her criteria,or if he is a complany or offers a job position to create
a job offer and provide with some auto matched job seekers that meet the criteria of the available position.

============================================================

In the current version it only gets to the point the lets you create a user,login,logout,edit your user and delete your user.

Future goals is to make the user be able to create o full fledged profile with info, make the mechanism responsible for the match
of job offers and users work and finaly figure out how to let the users decide if they want to get "mached" or not.

Any porposals are welcome! :)
